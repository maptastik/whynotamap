# Why Not a Map?
Although maps have become easier to make and more ubiquitous in the dataviz field, there still are many times that local governments, news outlets, and other organizations describe locations based on lists and vague location descriptions. This project seeks to do two things

1. When an organization publishes something with information that could be better communicated via a map, make that map.
2. Detail how to make the same map.

By doing this, the public can have nice visualization of some hard-to-read, listed info while also offering a way for those who did not make the map learn how they could do so in the future.
